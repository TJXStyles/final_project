# Comic Book Collector Database

This is my final project for Bitmaker Labs. It is an online database to store your collected works.

* Search for comic books

* Keep track of your comic books.

* Add comics to customizable collections.

* Create pull lists and email them to your local comic book shop.

* Comic book reviews.

* Share your collection with your friends and see their collection.

* Uses [Comicvine api](http://www.comicvine.com/api/)
